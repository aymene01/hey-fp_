# What is a Functor?

A functor is a mathematical concept that is used in functional programming to represent a container or wrapper for a value, along with the ability to apply a function to the value in a predictable way.

In other words, a functor is an object that has a `map` method, which can be used to apply a function to the value wrapped inside the functor.

Here's an example of a functor in TypeScript:

```ts
interface Functor<T> {
	map<U>(fn: (x: T) => U): Functor<U>
}

const Box = <T>(x: T): Functor<T> => ({
	map: <U>(fn: (x: T) => U): Functor<U> => Box(fn(x)),
})

const double = () => Box(5).map(num => num * 2)
```
