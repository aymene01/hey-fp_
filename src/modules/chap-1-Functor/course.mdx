# What is a Functor?

A functor is a mathematical concept that is used in functional programming to represent a container or wrapper for a value, along with the ability to apply a function to the value in a predictable way.

In other words, a functor is an object that has a `map` method, which can be used to apply a function to the value wrapped inside the functor.

Here's an example of a functor in TypeScript:

```ts
interface Functor<T> {
	map<U>(fn: (x: T) => U): Functor<U>
}

const Box = <T>(x: T): Functor<T> => ({
	map: <U>(fn: (x: T) => U): Functor<U> => Box(fn(x)),
})

const double = (num: number) =>
	Box(num)
		.map(myNum => myNum * 2)
		.map(myDoubleNum => myDoubleNum.toString())

console.log(double(5)) // Box('10')
```

But in this case we get a `Box` object, which is a functor, and not a number. This is because the `map` method returns a new functor, which is a wrapper around the result of the function.

And we want to get the result of the function, not the functor. So we need to unwrap the value from the functor.

This is where come `fold` method. It's used to unwrap the value from the functor.

```ts
interface Functor<T> {
	map<U>(fn: (x: T) => U): Functor<U>
	fold<U>(fn: (x: T) => U): U
}

const Box = <T>(x: T): Functor<T> => ({
	map: <U>(fn: (x: T) => U): Functor<U> => Box(fn(x)),
	fold: <U>(fn: (x: T) => U): U => fn(x),
})

const double = (num: number): number =>
	Box(num)
		.map(num => num * 2)
		.fold(num => num)

console.log(double(5)) // 10
```

Nice and simple. Now we can use `fold` method to unwrap the value from the functor and get the result of the function.

But in certain case we can have nested functors, like this:
